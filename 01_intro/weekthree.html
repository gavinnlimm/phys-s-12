            1. Kinetic Sculpture
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the second and third week, we were taught a range of essential skills and techniques with the
            equipment within the lab.
            For instance, we learned to use hand saws, and other tools such as vernier calipers, hand files and the
            bench grinder. In addition,
            we were also familiarized with using the hand drills and drill presses. With this given knowledge, we were
            tasked to create a kinetic sculpture.

            The two photos below served as inspiration for my kinetic sculpture, as I attempted to create a rotating
            device that would move an interesting shape to create an optical illusion.

        <p>
            First, I created a 2D design of one of the hands of the shape. I then utilized the circular pattern tool to create 10 other hands around the center of the shape.
            After creating all of these shapes, I used the combine tool to fused all of these shapes into one.
            Here is how I designed the shape in Fusion 360:

            With this model and a medium of scrap plywood, I laser cutted these shapes.

<!-- 

    Assignment:
1. Create a kinetic sculpture. (Include circuitry to move your sculpture)
2. Use a multimeter to measure the voltages in your circuit. Use Ohm's law to calculate current through the circuit.
3. Gif of kinetic sculpture

4. Document Arduino code (and show functions and meaning of code); make it copy and pastable
5. Draw a schematic of your circuit. Use a hand sketch, Flastad, Fusion 360 (Eagle), or other.
