            1. Kinetic Sculpture
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the second and third week, we were taught a range of essential skills and techniques with the
            equipment within the lab.
            For instance, we learned to use hand saws, and other tools such as vernier calipers, hand files and the
            bench grinder. In addition,
            we were also familiarized with using the hand drills and drill presses. With this given knowledge, we were
            tasked to create a kinetic sculpture.

            The two photos below served as inspiration for my kinetic sculpture, as I attempted to create a rotating
            device that would move an interesting shape to create an optical illusion.

            Design Phase (Fusion360):
        </p>
        <p>
            To create the shape, I started by designing a 2D hand shape. Using Fusion 360, I utilized the circular
            pattern tool to replicate the hand shape around the center, creating a total of 10 hands. After completing
            the duplication process, I employed the combine tool to merge all of these
            individual hand shapes into a single cohesive shape.

            Laser Cutting Phase:
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            After designing the 2D model of the shape, I implemented this onto the laser cutter using a medium of
            plywood. I also then used a hand drill to create a small hole (with the same size as the wooden rod) in the
            center of the shape.
            Furthermore, I also attached a wooden rod to the end of one of the axles on the motor. This was because the
            motor's original axle was too short to fully fit through the hole of the shape that I designed.
            Using a heat shrink tube, I connected a wooden rod to the end of one of the motors.

        </div>

        <br>

        <p>
            The next step was to create a running motor which would have an axle that would go through the hole of the
            shape. Using an arduino (micro-controller), I programmed a sequence which would use a potentiometer to
            control the speed of a specific motor. Above is a picture of my setup and below the Arduino code I used to
            control the potentiometer and the motor.

            After completing the rotating object, I needed to create a structural base for the kinetic sculpture. What I
            initially planned was to create a box that would hold all of the components of the sculpture in place.
            Thus, with my knowledge in press-fit models, I constructed a box on Fusion360, and printed it out. Here is
            how it came out:

3. Gif of kinetic sculpture

4. Document Arduino code (and show functions and meaning of code); make it copy and pastable
5. Draw a schematic of your circuit. Use a hand sketch, Flastad, Fusion 360 (Eagle), or other.
