    <!-- Assignment:
1. Use a sensor to measure a physical quantity with your microcontroller. Calibrate your sensor (describe the range between its min and max values, and whether/how you can control this range). Show data in the form of a table or graph.
2. Do the same as (1) with a capacitive sensor you have fabricated yourself using copper tape, aluminum foil, Velostat, etc. -->

            Throughout this week, we were taught how to build specific circuits, and implement different types of
            resistors to manipulate the circuit to measure a specific value. Some of the resistors that we explored
            included thermistors for temperature changes, force-sensitive resistors for pressure/force detection,
            phototransistors/photresistors for light detection, and accelerometers for motion.

            1. Photoresistor Circuit
        </p>

        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
            So, for the first assignment, we were tasked to use a given sensor to measure a physical quantity using the
            microcontroller (Arduino Uno). The picture on the bottom left depicts the circuit model that I followed, and
            the picture on the bottom right shows how I implemented this model onto an Arduino.

        <p>
            After completing the circuitry, I installed a program into the Arduino that detects the change in resistance
            within the circuit. The reason for this is because the photoresistor within the circuit changes its
            resistance as a function of light. As it receives more light its resistance decreases, and the voltage at
            the point labeled A0 decreases. Below is the code that I used for this:

              <code>
                /*
                  AnalogReadSerial
          
                  Reads an analog input on pin 0, prints the result to the Serial Monitor.
                  Graphical representation is available using Serial Plotter (Tools > Serial Plotter menu).
                  Attach the center pin of a potentiometer to pin A0, and the outside pins to +5V and ground.
          
                  This example code is in the public domain.

                // the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
                void setup() {
                  // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
                  Serial.begin(9600);
                }
          
                // the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
                void loop() {
                  // read the input on analog pin 0:
                  int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
                  // print out the value you read:
                  Serial.println(sensorValue);
                  delay(1);  // delay in between reads for stability

        <p>
            Through this experiment, I discovered that the minimum value that was recorded by the photoresistor was
            zero, and that the maximum was somewhat approximately 450 (with the iPhone flashlight directly on the top of
            the photoresistor).

            2. Capacitive Sensor
        </p>

        <p>
            Another part of this week's assignment was to create a capacitive sensor. In my case, I created a circuit
            that uses two metallic sheets to vary the amount of voltage/current that is passing through the circuit.
