            Throughout this week, we were taught how to build specific circuits, and implement different types of
            resistors to manipulate the circuit to measure a specific value. Some of the resistors that we explored
            included thermistors for temperature changes, force-sensitive resistors for pressure/force detection,
            phototransistors/photresistors for light detection, and accelerometers for motion.

            1. Photoresistor Circuit
        </p>

        <p>
            For the first assignment, we were tasked to use a given sensor to measure a physical quantity using the
            Arduino Uno Microcontroller. Thus, I attempted to use a photoresistor to measure the amount of voltage that
            is transmitted through a circuit. The picture on the bottom left depicts the circuit model that I followed,
            and
            the picture on the bottom right shows how I implemented this model onto an Arduino.
        </p>

        <p>
            After completing the circuitry, I installed a program into the Arduino that detects the change in resistance
            within the circuit. The reason for this is because the photoresistor within the circuit changes its
            resistance as a function of light. As it receives more light its resistance decreases, and the voltage at
            the point labeled A0 decreases. Below is the code that I used for this:

            // the setup routine runs once when you press reset:
            void setup() {
                // initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:
                Serial.begin(9600);
            }

            // the loop routine runs over and over again forever:
            void loop() {
                // read the input on analog pin 0:
                int sensorValue = analogRead(A0);
                // print out the value you read:
                Serial.println(sensorValue);
                delay(1);  // delay in between reads for stability
            }

        <br>

        <p>
            Within this program, the setup() function initailizes the communication between the Arduino Uno
            Microcontroller and the connected photoresistor.
            This connection itself allows for real-time communication, enabling the Arduino to simulataneously send and
            receive data between the photoresistor and the computer.
        </p>

        <p>
            Furthermore, the loop() function in this code allows the Arduio to continously read the analog input from
            pin A0 using the
            analogRead(A0) function, which measures the voltage level on the pin. This value of voltage is then stored
            in the variable sensorValue.
            The program then continues to print this voltage value (sensorvalue) to the Serial Monitor within the
            Arduino IDE application.
            This allows for us to observe the values received by the photoresistor in real-time.

        <p>
            Using my iPhone flashlight, I was able manipulate the amount of voltage that was being transmitted across
            the circuit. By putting the flashlight closer to the photoresistor, the photoresistor recorded up an
            increased amount of voltage. Vice versa; when the flashlight got further away from the photoresistor, the
            values recorded by the resistor decreased.
        </p>
        <p>
            Through the visualization of the graph, I discovered the maximum
            value recorded by the photoresistor was
            approximately 450.
        </p>
        <em>
            Keep in mind that this value was recorded with the iPhone flashlight directly above the
            photoresistor, allowing the photoresistor to measure the maximum amount of voltage that could be
            recorded
            through the photoresistor. In addition, the minimum value recorded was zero.

            2. Capacitive Sensor
        </p>

        <p>
            Another part of this week's assignment was to create a capacitive sensor. In my case, I created a capacitive
            sensor
            that uses two metallic sheets to vary the amount of voltage/current that is passing through the circuit. In
            this particular case, the two metallic sheets act as conductive elements; meaning that when they are brought
            closer to one another,
            the resulting capacitance between them increases. An increase in capacitance therefore causes the amount of
            voltage passing through the circuit to increase. Below is a picture of the capacitive sensor:

    <br>

    <p class="description">
        Another important thing to note is that the use of the foam block between the two metal sheets is essential for
        one reason:
    </p>
    <p class="description">
        <b>Preventing a Short Circuit:</b>
        Without the use of the foam block, the two metallic sheets would be in direct contact, causing a
        low-resistance path for the current to flow, and ultimately causing a short circuit. The use of the block
        prevents this short circuit from happening, as it acts as an insulator between the two metallic sheets.

            After successfully installing the program into the Arduino Uno and setting up the circuit, I tested the
            capactive sensor. Below is a video of the Serial Monitor in the Arduino application, that allowed me to
            track the capacitance within the circuit.

    <p class="description">
        As we can see from the video, the capacitance sensor worked out successfully. The more pressure that I put on
        the two metallic sheets, and the more that they got closer to one another, the capacitance captured increased.
