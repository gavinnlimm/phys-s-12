            In week 7 of our class, we delved into an exciting array of topics related to electronics and
            microcontrollers.
            The week began with a thorough review of our previous assignments, offering valuable feedback and addressing
            any
            questions raised by the students. We then dived into a Servo Motor Workshop, where we learned how to control
            these precise motors using microcontrollers like the ESP32. Another significant aspect of our learning was
            understanding the use of an oscilloscope, a crucial tool in electronics, to visualize electrical signals
            effectively. During a well-deserved break, we utilized our time to install essential drivers for ESP32
            and/or
            ESP32-CAM microcontrollers. However, the highlight of the week was the Output Device Extravaganza, where we
            got
            hands-on experience choosing from various output devices, including RGB LEDs, LED Strips, OLED/TFT displays,
            Piezo Buzzers, and even EMF devices like solenoids. Through these practical exercises, we honed our skills
            in
            interfacing, circuit control, and programming, enabling us to create intriguing projects with the
            microcontrollers and other electronic components.

            Throughout this class, we were assigned to create a circuit that integrates at least one input device and
            one output device. Thus, I first tried to create a circuit that

    <!-- 
Use an output device that you haven't used before today.
Write a microcontroller program that integrates at least one input device and one output device. Avoid the delay() function and use the C++ class structure.
Use an oscilloscope to discover the time domain at which your output device is operating. Is it on a fixed clock? What's its speed? Share images and describe your findings.
