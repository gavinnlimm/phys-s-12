        <p>
            During week 7, we delved into an exciting array of subjects within the world of microcontrollers.
            First, we learned how to operate a Servo Motor, and manipulate programs within microcontrollers such as an
            ESP32 to control these motors.
            Then, we dove deeper into the many different output devices that were available within the lab. For instance
            we learned how to operate RGB/LED strips, and manipulate the color within these individual channel. We also
            looked into the use of OLED/TFT displays, and changing programs to display different things on the screens.

            1. Arduino-Based Musical Circuit w/ Piezo Buzzer
        </p>

        <p>
            Out of all of the output devices that we could choose from, I found the Piezo Buzzer the most interesting.
            Therefore, I attempted to create a circuit that used a program within an Arduino to play a song on a Piezo
            Buzzer.
            Below are two pictures: one of a circuit model that I followed to setup the Piezo Buzzer. Another picture
            shows how I implemented this circuit model onto a real Arduino.

            After having successfully assembled the circuit, the next step was to incorporate a program into the
            circuit.
            In pursuit of a fitting piece of music to play through the Piezo Buzzer, I found an online program that was
            coded
            to play the Game of Thrones theme song.

            Adding an Input Device
        </p>

        <p>
            After successfully creating the circuit, I wanted to add an input device, which would control whether if the
            sound from the Piezo Buzzer was going to be played or not. Thus, I changed the circuit and made sure that
            the current had to go through a button in order to reach the
            output device. Furthermore, I wanted to experiment with a different device, so instead of a Piezo Buzzer, I
            soldered the end of a wire to a speaker. Then, I
            replaced the Piezo Buzzer in the circuit with this speaker.
