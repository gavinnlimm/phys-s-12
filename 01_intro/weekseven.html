        <p>
            During week 7, we delved into an exciting array of subjects within the world of microcontrollers.
            First, we learned how to operate a Servo Motor, and manipulate programs within microcontrollers such as an
            ESP32 to control these motors.
            Then, we dove deeper into the many different output devices that were available within the lab. For instance
            we learned how to operate RGB/LED strips, and manipulate the color within these individual channel. We also
            looked into the use of OLED/TFT displays, and changing programs to display different things on the screens.
            Furthermore,
            In addition, we also learned how to use an oscilloscope, to visualize
            electrical signals effectively.
