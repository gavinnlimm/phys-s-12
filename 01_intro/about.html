            Hello everyone, my name is Gavin Lim, and I am a rising junior in the Harvard Secondary Summer School
            Program. I was born in Singapore, but I am originally from Jakarta, Indonesia. Some of the sports that I
            play include basketball and football. And in my free time, I like to play the guitar or the piano. In
            addition, I also have a strong passion for STEM fields such as aerospace/mechanical engineering. I plan to study one
            of these topics when I graduate highschool.
