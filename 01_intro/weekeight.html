        <p>
            Within the 8th week, we explored the concept of CNC machining, and explored the many different features that
            CNC machining has to offer.
            In addition, we experimented with and learned how to use several different devices that use CNC modeling.
            Some of the machines that we used included: the ShopBot, the Shaper, and the monoFab SRM-20 milling machine.

            <b>Assignment:</b> To design an object using CNC and create an object by molding and casting.

            Design Phase
        </p>

        <p>
            My plan was to create a mold for the molding/casting project using the monoFab SRM-20
            milling machine. Using a wax block as my medium, I wanted to use the milling machine to create a mold for an
            interesting shape.
            So, first I used Fusion360 to create this shape, which would later be implemented onto the CNC mill.

    <p class="description">
        First, I created a body of a object; using the eclipse tool and the circular pattern tool, I created the 2D
        design of the object.
        After this, I extruded it to a certain degree, and then added filleted edges along the bottom side of the
        object.

    <p class="description">
        After creating 3D model of my intended object, I created another body (box) representing the wax block that I
        was going to mill out of.
        Then, using the extruding tool, I cut out my intended object from the block, which would later then be used for
        the mold.

            CNC Milling: Roughing Pass
        </p>

        <p>
            Once I created the STL file for the object, I needed to start milling the mold onto the wax block. So, I
            installed the STL file into a USB and used the monoFab SRM-20 milling machine to start the first step in the
            milling process: the roughing pass. Below are the setup configurations that I used for the roughing pass:

            Finishing Pass
        </p>

        <p>
            After completing the roughing pass of the milling process (using the 1/8th inch drill), I then utilized a
            smaller drill of approximately 1/16th of an inch for a drill. This allowed me to create a more detailed
            shape on the wax block, with
            finer edges. Additionally, this smaller drill allowed for the filleted edges on the bottom side of my
            object.

        <p>
            After successfully milling out the mold for this assignment, I used a mixture of casting solutions and waited approximately 6 hours for the cast to fully cure.
