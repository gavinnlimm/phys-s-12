            vision: what inspired me to make this?
        <p>One of my personal passions include playing musical instruments such as the guitar. I wanted to create a simple device/mechanism that would support guitar players, so I found one specific problem that all players struggle with: tuning.
            Being a passioniate guitar player, I realize and understand the frustration that some guitar players experience while trying to manually tune the six strings on a guitar.
            Therefore, through this final project, I have decided to develop a device that not only simplifies, but automates this entire process.

            the automatic guitar tuner will consist of <b>two main components:</b>
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li><b>The Frequency Detector</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The frequency detector will be responsible for detecting the current frequency of a specific
                    string on the guitar. With the use of a microphone, and signal processing techniques, the frequency
                    detector will be able to
                    analyze the audio input from the guitar. Furthermore, by determining the frequency, it will provide
                    real-time
                    feedback on how to correctly tune the guitar strings.</li>
            </ul>

            <br>

            <div class="image-container">

            </div>
            
            <br>

            <li><b>The Peg Adjustment System</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li>The motor-controlled peg adjustment system will be connected to the tuning pegs of the guitar. Based
                    on
                    the feedback received from the frequency detector, this system will automatically adjust the pegs to
                    achieve the correct frequency for each string. The motor will rotate the pegs in the required
                    direction
                    until the desired frequency is reached.</li>
            </ul>
        </ol>
