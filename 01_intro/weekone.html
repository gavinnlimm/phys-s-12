        <h2>Final Project Proposal: Automatic Guitar Tuner</h2>
        <p>
            For my final project in this engineering class, I am excited to propose the creation of an automatic guitar
            tuner. As a passionate guitar player, I understand the frustration that comes with tuning the guitar strings
            manually. Therefore, I aim to develop a device that simplifies and automates this process.
        </p>

        <h3>Project Description:</h3>
        <p>
            The automatic guitar tuner will consist of two main components: a frequency detector and a motor-controlled
            peg adjustment system.
        </p>
        <p>
            The frequency detector will be responsible for accurately detecting the current frequency of a specific
            string on the guitar. It will utilize a combination of microphone and signal processing techniques to analyze
            the audio input from the guitar. By determining the frequency, it will provide real-time feedback on whether
            the string is tuned correctly or not.
        </p>
        <p>
            The motor-controlled peg adjustment system will be connected to the tuning pegs of the guitar. Based on the
            feedback received from the frequency detector, this system will automatically adjust the pegs to achieve the
            correct frequency for each string. The motor will rotate the pegs in the required direction until the desired
            frequency is reached.
