            <h1> Final Project Proposal: Automatic Guitar Tuner </h1>
            <p> Short Description: I proposed the creation of an "automatic guitar tuner". As a passioniate guitar
                player, I realize the frustration for some people that comes with tuning the strings on a guitar
                manually. So, through this project, I am to develop a simple device that simplifies and automates this
                entire process. </p>
            <p> The automatic guitar tuner will consist of two main components: a frequency detector and a
                motor-controlled peg adjustment system. </p>
            <h5> The Frequency Detector: </h5>
            <p> The frequency detector will be responsible for accurately detecting the current frequency of a specific
                string on the guitar. It will utilize a combination of microphone and signal processing techniques to
                analyze the audio input from the guitar. By determining the frequency, it will provide real-time
                feedback on whether the string is tuned correctly or not.</p>
            <h5>The Peg Adjustment System:</h5>
            <p> The motor-controlled peg adjustment system will be connected to the tuning pegs of the guitar. Based on
                the feedback received from the frequency detector, this system will automatically adjust the pegs to
                achieve the correct frequency for each string. The motor will rotate the pegs in the required direction
                until the desired frequency is reached. </p>
