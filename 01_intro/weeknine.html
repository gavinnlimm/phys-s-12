            1. Wireless Control (Microcontroller)
        </p>
        <p>
            Week nine of our class promises to be a captivating and knowledge-packed session focused on ESP32 devices,
            wireless communication, and networking. The agenda begins with an Assignment Review at 12:00, providing
            students with valuable feedback on their recent work. At 12:30, we will dive into setting up ESP32 devices,
            enabling us to explore their capabilities and functionalities. The session will then move on to ESP-NOW
            Radio at 12:45, where we will learn about this communication protocol and its applications in wireless data
            transmission. Following this, at 1:00, we will delve into the world of Wired Communication, covering digital
            I/O and Wired Serial Communication. A comprehensive overview of WiFi and Bluetooth is scheduled for 1:15,
            providing insights into these essential wireless communication technologies. The session after the break at
            1:45 will be dedicated to identifying the networking needs for our final projects, ensuring that we have a
            clear understanding of the requirements. The highlight of the week will be the Wireless Networking Workshop
            at 2:00, offering various options for exploration, including LAN Server setup, Remote Server using Firebase,
            HTTP Client for APIs and web scrapers, Bluetooth applications, tutorials from RandomNerd, and Arduino IoT
            Cloud exemplified by Faraz's example. This hands-on workshop will empower us with the skills and knowledge
            needed to design and implement wireless networking solutions for our projects, making week nine an engaging
            and practical experience.

            I worked with a partner in class (Ali Cicek) to create a circuit which consisted of a lightbulb that could
            be switched on and off through the use of our computers via WIFI connection.

        <p>First, I opened up Fusion 360, and crafted out a triangle. I then utilized the mirror and circular pattern
            tool to create the shape of the shuriken.
            After that, I crate construction lines in the middle of the shuriken, which would then be used to create the
            wedges in the shuriken, that would allow each individual shape to connect to one another.
            These wedges measure precisely 3.8mm in length.

            After completing the design of the shuriken, I utilized the extruding tool to generate the thickness of the
            2d object. This thickness (3.8mm) matched the thickness of the medium that we were using in the laser
            cutter: cardboard.

            Here below you can see the final results of shuriken. One limitation in my process of designing the
            shuriken, was getting the nothces between each side of the shuriken to perfectly fit with the thickness of
            the cardboard.
            When initially laser cutting the cardboard, I realized that I should have made the width of the notches (in
            Fusion360) a little smaller than the actual thickness of the cardboard. This was because the laser cutter
            did burn off some of the cardboard, causing the size of the notches to be slightly bigger than planned.
